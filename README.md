[00:04.63] The castles are built just to fall
[00:08.96] I thought I could hold up the wall
[00:13.22] The soldiers are standing there tall
[00:17.65] They let their guard down when you sang and you kissed them all
[00:22.85] The castle is me
[00:25.88] Be careful the lies you believe about me
[00:31.57] Can't you see?
[00:34.86] We broke the truce and now here come the enemies
[00:39.08] (He's telling us a story)
[00:51.58] 
[00:40.06] You leave my tears on your face
[00:43.22] 'Til it's a little bit too late
[00:46.41] A little bit too late
[00:48.35] Decisions are having a face
[00:51.84] Yeah, they've been killing me to make
[00:54.98] Killing me to make
[01:03.98] 
[00:57.05] The knife in my back is the least of my worries
[01:02.49] The blood's on your hands
[01:05.72] You left a scar in your place
[01:09.08] And it's been written in your name, so you can kill me for always
[01:41.58] 
[01:15.43] Always, always
[01:19.59] So you can kill me for always
[01:24.05] Always, always
[01:28.13] So you can kill me for always
[01:42.63] 
[01:39.97] The comforting tale that you told
[01:44.17] I thought it would never get old
[01:47.95] But these poisonous hands that I hold
[01:52.66] They tore up my gardens, burnt them
[01:56.16] Every last rose in the garden is me
[02:01.05] I colored my blood, so you'd see what I want you to see
[02:06.66] And I can't sleep
[02:09.32] In the shadows of statues you've built out of me
[02:33.32] 
[02:14.49] You leave my tears on your face
[02:17.53] 'Til it's a little bit too late (little bit too late)
[02:20.65] A little bit too late (little bit too late)
[02:22.74] Decisions are having a face
[02:26.08] Yeah, they've been killing me to make (killing me to make)
[02:29.33] Killing me to make (killing me to make)
[02:48.83] 
[02:31.22] The knife in my back is the least of my worries
[02:36.74] The blood's on your hands (your hands)
[02:40.00] You left a scar in your place
[02:43.18] And it's been written in your name, so you can kill me for always
[03:15.68] 
[02:49.87] Always (always), always (always)
[02:53.82] So you can kill me for always
[02:57.83] Always (always), always (always)
[03:02.42] So you can kill me for always
